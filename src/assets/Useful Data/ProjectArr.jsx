			"This project is a Gaming hub displaying different games on different systems, different categories, and with ratings. Using an API from Rawg I was able to fetch different game titles with details such as the ratings. A search bar was also added for clients to be able to search for those titles they seek. I implemented a dark mode as well which helped me learn more about working with color themes with chakra ui. Using chakra ui for my styles, got me to learn a new library as i was making this app. Learning on top of learning while building is always a plus! This project allowed me to also increase my JavaScript knowledge as new/different tasks showed itself while building. I loved this project as it allowed me to combine my passion for frontend development and gaming.",
